# üìò ORDER BY Clause in SQL

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts query results in **ascending (ASC)** or **descending (DESC)** order.
Default = `ASC` (ascending).

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ ORDER BY with a Single Column

```sql
-- Sort employees by salary (low to high)
SELECT emp_id, name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary ASC;

-- Sort employees by hire date (most recent first)
SELECT emp_id, name, hire_date
FROM Employees
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
```

üëâ **Notes**

* `ASC` = smallest ‚Üí largest (default)
* `DESC` = largest ‚Üí smallest

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ ORDER BY with Multiple Columns

When multiple columns are specified, SQL sorts **first by the first column, then by the second within ties, etc.**

```sql
-- Sort by department first, then by salary descending
SELECT name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY dept_id ASC, salary DESC;
```

üëâ If two employees are in the same department, their salaries decide their order.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ ORDER BY with Column Position (not recommended)

You can use the column‚Äôs **ordinal position** in the `SELECT` list:

```sql
SELECT name, salary, dept_id
FROM Employees
ORDER BY 2 DESC;   -- orders by salary (2nd column)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended in production because if you reorder `SELECT` list, sorting changes unexpectedly.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ ORDER BY with Aliases

```sql
SELECT name, salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY annual_salary DESC;
```

üëâ Aliases can be used in `ORDER BY`, even though not allowed in `WHERE`.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ ORDER BY with Functions

You can sort by **computed expressions**:

```sql
-- Sort by length of employee names
SELECT name
FROM Employees
ORDER BY LENGTH(name);

-- Sort by year of hire
SELECT name, hire_date
FROM Employees
ORDER BY YEAR(hire_date);
```

üëâ Useful when you don‚Äôt have a dedicated column but want derived sorting.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ ORDER BY with CASE (Custom Sorting)

`CASE` lets you define **custom sort orders** not based on alphabet/number rules.

```sql
-- Custom sort: Active employees first, then inactive
SELECT name, is_active
FROM Employees
ORDER BY CASE WHEN is_active = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 2 END;

-- Custom sort for department priority
SELECT name, dept_id
FROM Employees
ORDER BY 
  CASE dept_id
    WHEN 3 THEN 1   -- HR first
    WHEN 1 THEN 2   -- Sales second
    ELSE 3          -- Others later
  END;
```

üëâ Very powerful when business rules require **non-natural ordering**.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Handling NULL Values in ORDER BY

* By default:

  * **MySQL** ‚Üí `NULL` is considered **lowest value** (appears first in ASC, last in DESC).
  * **Oracle** ‚Üí `NULLS LAST` by default.
  * **Postgres** ‚Üí ASC ‚Üí NULLS first, DESC ‚Üí NULLS last.
* You can **explicitly control** with `NULLS FIRST` / `NULLS LAST` (Postgres, Oracle, SQL Server 2022+).

### Examples

```sql
-- Place NULLs last explicitly
SELECT name, manager_id
FROM Employees
ORDER BY manager_id ASC NULLS LAST;

-- Place NULLs first
SELECT name, manager_id
FROM Employees
ORDER BY manager_id DESC NULLS FIRST;
```

üëâ In MySQL (which doesn‚Äôt support `NULLS FIRST/LAST`), use `CASE`:

```sql
-- MySQL way to push NULLs last
SELECT name, manager_id
FROM Employees
ORDER BY (manager_id IS NULL), manager_id;
```

Here `(manager_id IS NULL)` returns `1` for nulls and `0` for not null ‚Üí ensures nulls are pushed to the end.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ ORDER BY in Subqueries and LIMIT

Often combined with `LIMIT` / `TOP` for pagination or ‚ÄúTop N‚Äù queries.

```sql
-- Top 5 highest-paid employees
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;   -- MySQL/Postgres (SQL Server: TOP 5, Oracle: FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY)
```

| CASE (custom order) | `ORDER BY CASE dept_id WHEN 3 THEN 1 ELSE 2 END`                               |
| Handle NULLs        | `ORDER BY manager_id NULLS LAST` (or `ORDER BY (manager_id IS NULL)` in MySQL) |

üëâ With this, you can sort **any dataset** exactly how you want ‚Äî by natural order, computed expressions, or even business logic.
