# ðŸ“˜ HAVING Clause in SQL

## ðŸ”¹ Definition
The **HAVING** clause is used to filter **groups of data created by GROUP BY**.  

It is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but:  
- `WHERE` filters **rows** before grouping.  
- `HAVING` filters **groups** after grouping.

## ðŸ”¹ Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
```

## ðŸ”¹ Difference Between WHERE and HAVING
| Feature           | WHERE Clause                                | HAVING Clause                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **When Applied**  | Before grouping (filters individual rows)   | After grouping (filters grouped results)   |
| **Used With**     | Can be used without `GROUP BY`              | Always used with `GROUP BY` (mostly)       |
| **Aggregate Func**| Cannot be used with aggregate functions     | Can be used with aggregate functions       |

## ðŸ”¹ Combined Example
### Query: Find departments with average salary greater than 60000

|------------|------------|
| IT         | 71666.67   |
