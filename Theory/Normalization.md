# üîé What is Normalization?

**Normalization** is a set of design techniques for relational databases that organizes tables and relationships to:

* **Reduce data redundancy** (no repeated data),
* **Avoid update/insert/delete anomalies**, and
* **Ensure data integrity** (via constraints and keys).

Normalization is achieved by decomposing tables into smaller, well-structured tables based on **functional dependencies** and **normal form** rules.

---

# üîë Key concepts (theory fundamentals)

* **Relation / Table** ‚Äî a set of tuples (rows) with attributes (columns).
* **Functional Dependency (FD)** ‚Äî For attributes X and Y, `X ‚Üí Y` means *value of X uniquely determines Y*.
  Example: `product_id ‚Üí product_name`. If two rows have same `product_id`, they must have same `product_name`.
* **Superkey** ‚Äî a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row.
* **Candidate key** ‚Äî minimal superkey (no subset is also a key).
* **Primary key** ‚Äî chosen candidate key for a table.
* **Partial dependency** ‚Äî a non-key attribute depends on part of a composite key (bad for 2NF).
* **Transitive dependency** ‚Äî A ‚Üí B and B ‚Üí C, so A ‚Üí C transitively (bad for 3NF).
* **Multivalued dependency (MVD)** ‚Äî A ‚Üí‚Üí B means for a given A there can be multiple B independent of other attributes.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Why normalize? (Data anomalies)

Consider a single table storing orders, customers, and products together. You can face:

* **Update anomaly** ‚Äî updating customer address requires changes in many rows; miss one and data is inconsistent.
* **Insert anomaly** ‚Äî you cannot insert a product into the catalog without an order (if product exists only as part of orders).
* **Delete anomaly** ‚Äî deleting the only order for a customer might delete the only record of that customer.

Normalization prevents these by separating distinct entities.

# 1NF ‚Üí 2NF ‚Üí 3NF ‚Üí BCNF ‚Üí 4NF ‚Üí 5NF (step-by-step theory + examples)

We‚Äôll start with an **unnormalized** example and progressively normalize it.

### UN-NORMALIZED example (bad)

A single `Orders` table:

| order\_id | order\_date | customer\_id | customer\_name | customer\_phone  | product\_id | product\_name | qty | price |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- | --- | ----- |
| 1         | 2025-09-01  | 101          | Alice          | 999-111, 999-222 | 1001        | Mouse         | 2   | 20.00 |
| 1         | 2025-09-01  | 101          | Alice          | 999-111, 999-222 | 1002        | Keyboard      | 1   | 45.00 |
| 2         | 2025-09-02  | 102          | Bob            | 888-333          | 1001        | Mouse         | 1   | 20.00 |

Problems:

* `customer_name` repeated for every order.
* `product_name` repeated for every order item.
* `customer_phone` has multiple phone numbers in one column (violates atomicity).

---

## ‚úÖ First Normal Form (1NF)

**Rule:** All attribute values must be *atomic* (indivisible) and each column must hold values of a single type. No repeating groups or arrays in a column.

**Fixes:**

* Split multi-valued phone column into separate rows or a separate table.
* Represent each order item as separate row (already shown) ‚Äî but ensure atomic columns.

**Example (1NF):** Keep the `Orders` rows as above but remove multi-valued fields. Move `customer_phone` to a separate table with one phone per row.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE CustomerPhones (
  customer_id INT,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, phone),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Precondition:** Table must be in 1NF.

**Rule:** No **partial dependencies** ‚Äî every non-key attribute must depend on the *entire* primary key. (Relevant only for tables with composite primary keys.)

**Typical violation example:**
Consider an `OrderItems` table with composite PK `(order_id, product_id)` and a column `product_name`:

| order\_id | product\_id | product\_name | qty |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | --- |
| 1         | 1001        | Mouse         | 2   |

Here `product_name` depends only on `product_id` (part of the composite key) ‚Üí **partial dependency**.

**Fix:**
Move product-related attributes to a `Products` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(100),
  price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_date DATE,
  customer_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  qty INT,
  PRIMARY KEY(order_id, product_id),
  FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
  FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);
```

Now `product_name` lives in `Products`, eliminating the partial dependency.

---

## ‚úÖ Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Precondition:** Table must be in 2NF.

**Rule:** No **transitive dependencies** ‚Äî non-key attributes must not depend on other non-key attributes. For any non-key attributes A, B, C, if `A ‚Üí B` and `B ‚Üí C`, then A‚ÜíC is transitive and must be removed.

**Example (transitive dependency):**
`Employees` table:

| emp\_id | emp\_name | dept\_id | dept\_name | dept\_head |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1       | Alice     | 10       | HR         | Carol      |

Here `dept_name` and `dept_head` depend on `dept_id`, and `dept_id` is stored alongside employee info. `dept_name` & `dept_head` are transitively dependent on `emp_id` via `dept_id`.

**Fix:**
Split out `Departments` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
  dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  dept_name VARCHAR(100),
  dept_head VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_name VARCHAR(100),
  dept_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY(dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);
```

Now `Employees` only stores dept\_id; department details are in `Departments`.

---

## ‚úÖ Boyce‚ÄìCodd Normal Form (BCNF)

**Stronger than 3NF.**

**Rule:** For every non-trivial functional dependency `X ‚Üí Y` in the relation, `X` must be a **superkey**. BCNF handles edge cases where 3NF may allow non-key determinants if they‚Äôre part of candidate keys.

**Example of BCNF violation:**
Table `R(Student, Course, Instructor)` with FDs:

* `(Student, Course)` is the PK.
* `Course ‚Üí Instructor` (a course has single instructor).
  `Course` is not a superkey (it does not uniquely identify rows), yet it determines `Instructor`. This violates BCNF.

**Fix:** Decompose into:

* `CourseInstructor (course, instructor)`
* `StudentCourse (student, course)`

Now `Course` ‚Üí `Instructor` is allowed in `CourseInstructor` where `Course` is a key.

---

## ‚úÖ Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

**Deals with multivalued dependencies (MVDs).**

**Rule:** No table should have more than one independent multivalued dependency ‚Äî every non-trivial MVD must be a consequence of the candidate key.

**Example:**
`EmployeeLanguagesPhones(employee_id, language, phone)` where:

* `employee_id ‚Üí‚Üí language` (employee may have multiple languages)
* `employee_id ‚Üí‚Üí phone` (employee may have multiple phones)

These two sets are independent. Storing both in same table forms Cartesian product of languages √ó phones causing redundancy.

**Fix:** Split into:

* `EmployeeLanguages(employee_id, language)`
* `EmployeePhones(employee_id, phone)`

---

## ‚úÖ Fifth Normal Form (5NF / PJNF)

5NF deals with **join dependencies** ‚Äî decompositions that can be joined losslessly and capture all constraints. Rare in practice. The idea: decompose relations so that reconstructing original table requires only joins and no spurious tuples.

---

# ‚úÖ Lossless Join & Dependency Preservation

* **Lossless-join decomposition:** When you decompose a relation into R1 and R2, joining R1 and R2 must give back the original relation without spurious rows. A sufficient condition: `(R1 ‚à© R2)` is a key for at least one of R1 or R2.

* **Dependency preservation:** After decomposition, you should be able to enforce original FDs by enforcing constraints on child tables (without having to join). Sometimes BCNF decompositions break dependency preservation ‚Äî you must then enforce constraints via triggers or application logic.

Trade-off: Perfect normalization (BCNF) might require extra joins or lose dependency preservation ‚Äî choose based on use-case.

# Practical, step-by-step normalization example (Orders ‚Üí Customers, Products, OrderItems)

### 1) Unnormalized table:

```sql
-- imagine single table OrdersFull (bad design)
```

Rows shown earlier ‚Äî contains customer repeated, product repeated.

### 2) Normalize to 1NF, 2NF, 3NF

**Create normalized schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(100),
  price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_date DATE,
  customer_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  qty INT,
  PRIMARY KEY(order_id, product_id),
  FOREIGN KEY(order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
  FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);
```

**Insert sample data:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Customers VALUES (101,'Alice','alice@example.com'), (102,'Bob','bob@example.com');

INSERT INTO Products VALUES (1001,'Mouse',20.00), (1002,'Keyboard',45.00);

INSERT INTO Orders VALUES (1,'2025-09-01',101), (2,'2025-09-02',102);

INSERT INTO OrderItems VALUES (1,1001,2), (1,1002,1), (2,1001,1);
```

**Query: Get full order details (join)**

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.name AS customer, p.product_name, oi.qty, p.price
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
ORDER BY o.order_id;
```

**Output:**

| order\_id | order\_date | customer | product\_name | qty | price |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- | --- | ----- |
| 1         | 2025-09-01  | Alice    | Mouse         | 2   | 20.00 |
| 1         | 2025-09-01  | Alice    | Keyboard      | 1   | 45.00 |
| 2         | 2025-09-02  | Bob      | Mouse         | 1   | 20.00 |

This normalized design avoids repeating customer and product info and prevents the anomalies.

# Practical rules / algorithm to normalize a table

1. **List all attributes** of your table.
2. **Identify candidate keys** (what uniquely identifies a row).
3. **List functional dependencies** (X ‚Üí Y).
4. Apply normal forms incrementally:

   * Ensure atomicity ‚Üí 1NF.
   * Remove partial dependencies ‚Üí 2NF.
   * Remove transitive dependencies ‚Üí 3NF.
   * Enforce BCNF if needed (check every FD).
   * Handle multivalued dependencies ‚Üí 4NF.
5. Decompose tables ensuring **lossless join** (test using intersection keys).
6. Check **dependency preservation**; if lost, consider tradeoffs.

# When to stop normalizing? (Practical trade-offs)

* For **OLTP (transactional)** systems: normalize to **3NF or BCNF** to preserve integrity and reduce redundancy.
* For **read-heavy/analytic (OLAP)** systems: denormalization often used for performance (fewer joins). Use materialized views, aggregated tables, or star/snowflake schemas.
* **Denormalize** only when profiling shows joins are the performance bottleneck and after careful consideration of update complexity.

---

# Denormalization techniques (when needed)

* Add redundant columns (store computed or lookup values).
* Use materialized views / summary tables.
* Precompute aggregates.
* Use caching layers (Redis) for hot data.
* Partitioning (horizontal) or sharding for scale.

Trade-off: improved read performance vs increased update complexity and storage.

---

# Best practices & tips

* Model entities and relationships using an **ER diagram** before creating tables.
* Prefer **surrogate keys (auto-increment)** for PKs unless a natural key is stable and small.
* Index **foreign keys** and columns used for joins and filtering.
* Document **functional dependencies** ‚Äî helps future maintenance.
* Use **CHECK constraints** and **foreign keys** for integrity.
* Normalize to **3NF** as a baseline for OLTP; move to BCNF only if needed.
* For reporting/data warehousing, use denormalized star schema.
